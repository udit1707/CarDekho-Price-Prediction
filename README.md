# CarDekho-Price-Prediction

The objective of this kernel is to use an example of vehicles and help reach a good r2 score using basic regression model upon various Data.viz techniques.
Hence,for instance, we get data from the car website CarDekho.com, filled with information on a wide variety of cars, including their selling price and present price. We realize that we can use this data to make sure we get a good deal on a new car. In particular, we can figure out exactly how much one should pay for a specific type of car. Now Comes the Linear Regression to our rescue!

Linear Regression is a method for discovering the relationship between two variables in the dataset, such as price of the car and the year it was made. Data Scientists rely on this method for solving a wide range of problems, especially when it comes to prediction.

## About the Dataset
